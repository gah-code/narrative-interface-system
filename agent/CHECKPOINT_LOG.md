# Agent Checkpoint Log

Running log of agent-assisted reviews for `gharo-ui-prototype`.

## Checkpoint 0 - Setup

- Date: 2025-11-19
- Summary: Bootstrapped Vite React TS app, added ESLint + Prettier, and created agent helper script for packaging code into checkpoints.

## Checkpoint 4 - UX & Accessibility Polish

- Date: 2025-11-24
- Summary: Added skip link, focusable main, aria labels, and scroll padding/margins to harmonize sticky header with anchor navigation and improve focus visibility and keyboard flow.

## Checkpoint 0 – Agent helper

- Date: 2025-11-20
- Summary: Replaced ts-node helper with plain JS `.mjs` script and verified checkpoint bundler.

## Checkpoint 1 – Static Data Shape

- Date: 2025-11-24
- Summary: Confirmed section union approach; simplified field names; ensured layout concerns remain in UI layer.

## Checkpoint 2 – SectionRenderer + Components

- Date: 2025-11-24
- Summary: Reviewed section boundaries, adjusted props and naming where needed, confirmed SectionRenderer is ready for a future CMS-backed data source.

## Checkpoint 3 – Tokens + Layout CSS

- Date: 2025-11-24
- Summary: Validated token naming and scales, adjusted contrast/spacing as needed, clarified separation between global layout and per-section styling.

## Checkpoint 4 – Static UX + Accessibility Review

- Date: 2025-11-24
- Artifacts:
  - src/components/layout/Page.tsx
  - src/styles/layout.css
- Summary:
  - Verified semantics for header/nav/main/section and skip link.
  - Adjusted focus styles and/or contrast where needed.
  - Confirmed scroll behavior with sticky header and anchor links using `scroll-margin-top`.
  - Tightened mobile spacing / wrapping for the nav on small screens.

## Checkpoint 7 – Contentful Integration & Mapping Review

- Date: 2025-11-24
- Summary:
  - Hardened CMS → TS mapping with a section mapper registry and safe array helpers.
  - Unknown section types now warn and are skipped instead of breaking the page.
  - Mapping layer remains layout-agnostic; UI continues to consume typed data only.
  - `npm run lint` passes.

## Checkpoint – Landing Page SEO Polish (Phase 9.1)

- Date: 2025-11-25
- Focus: SEO stack for the personal landing page (title, description, OG, structured data).

### Changes

- **Seo.tsx**
  - Sets a stable default `<title>` (e.g. “Gilberto Haro – Web Engineer & Content Systems”).
  - Ensures `<meta name="description">` is always present with a non-empty blurb.
  - Injects basic Open Graph tags:
    - `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type=website`, `og:url`, `og:image`.
  - Uses canonical URL + default OG image path when values are missing.

- **PersonSchema.tsx**
  - Now uses real:
    - Name and job title.
    - Production URL.
    - LinkedIn and GitHub URLs in `sameAs`.

- **index.html**
  - Head now has fallback:
    - `<title>` and meta description.
    - OG tags for non-JS crawlers / social scrapers.

- **Assets**
  - Added placeholder social card: `public/og/landing-default.png` (simple gradient) so OG image path resolves in all environments.

### Notes

- Can swap in a designed OG image at `public/og/landing-default.png` later.
- `<Seo />` still respects `meta.title` / `meta.description` from CMS; defaults catch missing values if Contentful content changes.
- Quick manual verification done:
  - `npm run dev` – inspected `<head>` for title/description/OG tags.
  - `npm run preview` – confirmed build works and OG path resolves.

## Checkpoint –

These checkpoints document the shift from the original my-landing-page-2026 build into the Narrative Interface System: one library of narrative sections, Contentful mappings, and layout patterns that can be reused across multiple surfaces. Each entry notes how the landing page stays stable while the underlying system becomes more modular and multi-surface ready
